Boxing and Un-Boxing:
-- If a value type is convert into  refrence type we call this process as boxing.
Ex: int x = 100;
Object obj = x; // Boxing

-- If the value type which is converted into refrence type which is again converted back into a value type we called as un-boxing, but here explicit type casting is required.

EX: int y = Convert.ToInt32(obj); // Un-Boxing
